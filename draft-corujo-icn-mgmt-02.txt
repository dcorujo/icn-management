                     ICN Management Considerations
                        draft-corujo-icn-mgmt-02

Abstract

   Motivated by the need to find and evaluate better ways for reaching
   on-line content in upcoming Future Internet environments, ICN has
   been increasingly deployed in an broad range of research and
   experimental actions.  Some deployments even go as far as subjecting
   ICN to new scenarios beyond content-reaching, exposing the
   flexibility of ICN core primitives in supporting such mechanisms.  In
   this sense, besides analyzing and discussing the role of network
   management procedures in ICN environments, this document also
   analyzes possibilities on how intrinsic core ICN mechanisms can be
   reutilized for network management.  We consider that the availability
   of management mechanisms for ICN will foster their deployment and, as
   such, should be tackled still in the design and experimentation
   phases.  Perhaps ICN can adapt successful mechanisms from the host-
   centric paradigm, or new network management schemes can be designed.
   Perhaps even both.  This document centralizes that discussion,
   drawing the attention of the ICNRG community to this underdeveloped
   area of research in ICN.

1.  Introduction

   Information-centric networking (ICN) enables new ideas for naming and
   addressing, privacy, security, and trust, and should also lead us to
   think new ways for deploying, operating and managing networks in the
   future.  By default, users, programs, information objects and hosts
   are in general untrustworthy and mobile in an information-centric

   network.  This means that many of the assumptions in traditional
   network management, including all aspects of FCAPS (Fault,
   Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security) need to be
   rethought.  However, despite the different instantiations of ICN
   architectures, and the plethora of novel research work built on top
   of them, little attention has been paid to management aspects so far.
   This includes both enabling "traditional" network management
   operations (which work well from small networks to large
   infrastructure networks), and supporting and optimizing intrinsic
   procedures of the ICN fabric.

   This document aims to draw the attention of ICNRG to the importance
   of network management for real-world deployments.  Today, network
   management is practically an add-on to host-centric deployments.  We
   can do better as we move forward in ICN research considering the full
   range of deployments from home-office environments to challenged
   networks to tier-1 networks.  To this end, we draft some first
   management considerations that, on the one hand, capitalize on ICN
   concepts for defining management procedures and, on the other,
   explore the possibilities for defining a common management framework
   irrespective of the ICN approach taken.  We reckon that the later is
   a much more formidable task and we are looking forward to tackling it
   together with other members of ICNRG.  In this document, different
   ICN research aspects tackled by ICNRG members are analyzed in respect
   to management possibilities and impact.

   We argue that addressing management at an early stage is not only
   important for real-world adoption and the successful future
   deployment of ICN, but also to deal with scenarios where management
   can simplify, enhance or optimize ICN network utilization and
   performance.  The subject becomes particularly challenging, as
   disparate characteristics from different ICN approaches (e.g., in
   terms of namespace, granularity, routing, and so on) impact the
   definition and design of these management mechanisms.  Section 2
   below provides an initial assessment, showcasing considerations on
   Face Management Section 2.1, Video Adaptation Section 2.2, Content
   Management Section 2.3and Network Policies Section 2.4.

   We plan to incrementally develop the draft, incorporating
   considerations on other ICN aspects as well as different approaches
   (e.g., [PURSUIT] and [NetInf]) as well as address other pertinent
   aspects as we receive feedback from the research group members.

2.  ICN Management Considerations

   This section addresses management considerations regarding specific
   ICN deployments and scenarios, by analyzing the opportunities,
   requirements and possibilities for management deployment therein.
   This analysis starts with the proposal of a NDN-based face management
   framework, followed by considerations from video adaptation, content
   management and network policies scenarios.

2.1.  Face Management

   The Named Data Networking [NDN] ICN architecture provides a new
   communication framework built on named data.  Like other ICN
   counterparts, such as [NetInf], [PURSUIT] and [DONA], NDN
   intrinsically supports security, routing/forwarding, reliability,
   caching and even mobility, aiming at scalable and more efficient
   content-distribution than today's IP-based approaches.  Fostered by
   an open-source implementation [CCNx], NDN has been at the heart of an
   active topic with several research contributions evaluating its
   deployment feasibility and performance in a number of scenarios
   [ICN-Scenarios].

   NDN relies on a hierarchical, human-readable namespace to address
   named data objects, where the naming scheme is simultaneously used to
   both name information and to route it.  It relies on content
   requesters sending an Interest packet with a Content Name, where the
   prefix can provide information for global and organizational routing,
   while the suffix indicates versioning and segmentation details.  When
   a node receives an Interest packet asking for content which matches
   what is already available at the node, it responds with a matching
   Data packet carrying back the content.

   Each NDN node comes with a set of supporting data structures which
   enable the coordination between the transmission of Interest packets
   with the reception of the corresponding Data packets.  These
   structures include:

   1.  Content Store: maintains an indication of locally available
       content, according to name, and is used for Interest packet
       matching.  If the content is available at the node, the Interest
       packet is consumed, and a Data packet with the respective content
       is sent towards the request origin.

Internet-Draft        ICN Management Considerations         October 2013


   2.  Pending Interest Table (PIT): keeps track of Interest packets
       seen previously by the node, on their way to locate matching
       content.  Interest packets in the PIT were not matched to content
       available in the node.  Basically, PIT maintains a degree of
       state regarding Interest packets, mapping them to a corresponding
       egress network interface.

   3.  Forward Information Base (FIB): associates named data to
       potential holders of the content.  A routing protocol can
       populate the FIB (although this is outside the scope of NDN) or
       it can be populated through registration in a local NDN store.

   NDN introduces the concept of a Strategy Layer, which can control
   Interest packet forwarding behavior.  It basically determines which
   is the best interface (or set of interfaces) to send an Interest
   packet.  The "strategy" component establishes a pre-configured
   algorithm for tackling Interest packet decisions, ranging from
   sending it sequentially on each interface until a Data packet is
   received, to evaluating which interfaces provide better performance
   (i.e., lower average RTT) in retrieving certain content (as discussed
   in [NDN]).

   It is important to keep in mind that NDN replaces the commonly used
   term "interface" with the term "face", since packets can be forwarded
   over hardware network interfaces as well as between application
   interfaces, further acknowledging the information dissemination
   capabilities of ICN.  This aspect is considered in [NDN] and [NDN-R],
   where programs can be associated to the NDN governing structures
   (like the FIB), defining configurations such as "sendToAll" and
   "sendToBest" with respect to managing the content reaching process.
   Corujo et al.  [NDN-MGMT] exploit these concepts enabling management
   mechanisms to be deployed, and steer network operations and NDN
   operation, as described in the following section.

2.1.1.  Towards a Management Framework for NDN

   An important aspect supporting network management procedures is the
   interaction of network information residing at the network side with
   information about the network from the perspective of clients
   connected to it.  The former includes, for instance, information
   stored in the network operator core about user profiles, associated
   policies, or data collected by the access network equipment, such as
   current and past traffic load levels, active flows, and maintenance
   information.  Today, such information can be retrieved for management
   and operation support through dedicated signaling protocols (e.g.,
   [RFC1157], [RFC6733]), or Operation Support Services (OSS) web
   services.  The client point of view of the network includes
   information that, for example, a wireless terminal can provide,

Internet-Draft        ICN Management Considerations         October 2013


   indicating wireless link quality, average return-trip times (RTT) or
   perceived Quality of Experience (QoE).

   Both types of information can be capitalized upon allowing, for
   example, the network to coordinate network management procedures,
   considering as input information obtained from other network elements
   as well as from user nodes.  One way to generate management
   information in network entities and at client nodes, as well as to
   consume and act upon it (i.e., using the management information
   exchange as a control channel) is to couple NDN nodes with Management
   Agent (MA) entities.

   Fig. 1 (redrawn here from [NDN-MGMT] for convenience) illustrates how
   a MA can be deployed in both network and client entities, interfacing
   with different operational aspects and protocol layers of an NDN
   node.  By using NDN content reaching and disseminating mechanisms,
   management information can be consumed by the MA to steer not only
   the behavior of application processes and network interfaces, but
   also to interface with NDN supporting structures (i.e. Content Store,
   FIB, PIT).  Effectively, different kinds of information can be
   conveyed to a network node responsible for managing the network
   (under different perspectives and processes), and resubmitted back
   towards client nodes, affecting the way applications interface with
   network interfaces and the NDN fabric.

   MA can interface with the PIT and FIB structures, acting as a
   dynamic, application- and/or network-controlled interface to the
   strategy layer.  This could also be used to direct how to forward NDN
   Interest and Data packets, in a configurable manner.  Regarding
   network interfaces, the MA can interface with them not only to
   control (i.e., initiate wireless access scanning procedures), but
   also to collect information (i.e., an informational event regarding
   detected access points).  Finally, the MA can also interface with
   application processes, drawing out information about the perceived
   QoS/QoE (e.g., lost packets or delay from a real-time video feed) and
   also to execute commands, such as selecting a better video codec when
   the network commands the video flow to be accessed from a different
   wireless access interface.

   Conversely, MA entities residing in network equipment can provide
   informational events as well, but related to network-side link layer
   characteristics (such as number of attached nodes or load), as well
   as accepting commands from the network (i.e., activate maintenance
   procedures).  Management processes residing in the network core can
   leverage information collected from applications, client terminals
   and network equipment, to drive optimization procedures.  Such
   optimization procedures can also tap into other entities, containing
   complementary information such as policies and subscription
   information, and use it to produce an overall network decision, which
   can then be forwarded to multiple client nodes, in a policy enforcing
   way.

   An important consideration from the NDN architecture, is the
   hierarchical namespace, allowing nodes to request and convey
   management data, by simply using an appropriate prefix (e.g., ccn://
   domain/management/ME).

   By leveraging the NDN information-centric dissemination mechanisms to
   convey management information and commands as content, these
   management extensions inherit the intrinsic capabilities of the NDN
   architecture, including security and reliability, which are
   fundamental for management procedures.

2.1.2.  NDN Management Operations

   In order to implement management operations, besides the interfacing
   capabilities of the MA entity mentioned in the previous section, a
   management framework needs other supporting mechanisms in order to
   provide the envisioned management capabilities, while maintaining the
   inherent NDN capabilities.  Concretely, when nodes connect to the
   network, the management entities need to become aware of the
   management capabilities of the newly-connected node.  In addition, an
   asynchronous information exchange capability needs to be provided,

   allowing not only the request of management information, but also the
   ability to push information towards a remote node (i.e., sending a
   command or an informational event).

2.1.2.1.  Discovery Procedure

   The discovery procedure is illustrated in Fig. 2 (redrawn from
   [NDN-MGMT]), and borrows for the procedures described in [NDN-VOIP].
   The procedure starts with the newly connected User Equipment (UE)
   broadcasting an Interest packet (Fig. 2:1) perhaps with a well-known
   content name (e.g., ccn://domain/management/mgmt-case/ME) to its
   local network.

   The "mgmt-case" part of the name can be used to select different
   aspects of management capabilities allowed by a Management Entity
   (ME) (i.e., a management decision point in the network).  The ME then
   replies to this Interest with a Data packet (Fig. 2:2), providing its
   shorthand identifier (i.e., ME-publisher-key) and a key locator,
   indicating how to retrieve its public key (assuming it is authorized
   by another key trusted by the UE).  In this way, the MA at the UE
   recognizes the ME as a valid signer (and provider) of management
   content.

   A session key, Ks, is generated by the MA, considering an encryption
   algorithm from the ones indicated by the ME in the Data packet.  The
   MA then expresses its desire to receive (and reply to) Interests
   matching a specific NDN name associated with the management service
   (e.g., ccn://domain/management/mgmt-case/ME/MA-publisher-id), where
   MA-publisher-id uniquely and globally identifies the MA, through a
   cryptographic digest of its public key.  After this, the MA sends an
   Interest packet (Fig. 2:3) to retrieve management Data from the ME
   containing the short-hand identifier of the MA (MA-publisher-id), the
   chosen encryption algorithm and session key (Ks), both encrypted with
   the public key of the ME.  In this way, the confidentiality of the
   content exchanged between the ME and the MA is guaranteed.  The ME
   responds with a Data packet (Fig. 2:4) signaling the reception of the
   session Key.

   Before the actual exchange of management data begins, the ME
   generates a challenge (i.e., a nonce) which is sent via an Interest
   packet (Fig. 2:5) to the MA, indicating through a named data name
   that it requests the reception of the response to this challenge,
   sent by the MA using a Data packet (Fig. 2:6).  This allows the ME,
   after verifying the signature of the Data packet, to verify that the
   encryption algorithm and the session key are valid for the MA, making
   it ready to exchange information for coordinating management
   procedures in the network.

2.1.2.2.  Management Data Exchange

   After the discovery and security establishment procedures have been
   finalized, the framework provides the capability for both the MA and
   the ME to securely obtain management content from one another.

   In order to push unsolicited content, a dual Interest/Data procedure
   can maintain compatibility with the Interest and Data exchange/
   consumption of the NDN architecture.  Fig. 3 (redrawn from Fig.2 of
   [NDN-MGMT]) illustrates the procedure which is initiated by the MA.
   In this case, the MA intends to push management information to the
   ME.  It does so via an Interest packet manifesting its interest in
   receiving management content with a local sequence number.  This

Internet-Draft        ICN Management Considerations         October 2013


   sequencing allows the recovery of new content over cached content.
   If the ME is interested in retrieving content from the MA, it answers
   back with a Data packet, where it indicates that it is willing to
   receive management content.  Then, the ME sends an Interest packet to
   retrieve the management data with the sequence number provided by the
   MA, which responds with a Data packet containing the information it
   wanted to push into the ME.

        Figure 3. Content Management Push


2.1.3.  Implementation Experience

   As a proof-of-concept, a software prototype of the management
   framework, [NDNFlexManager] was developed for [NDN-MGMT], using the
   CCNx Java API [CCNx].  At this early stage, it includes the
   implementation of an ME and an MA as NDN applications, supporting the
   NDN management operations outlined in Fig. 3.  Thus, the ME and the
   MA can push unsolicited content to each other, related with
   management operations.

   To validate this basic prototype, [NDN-MGMT] considered a specific
   use case supported by the framework, i.e., face management.  This
   entails configuring and selecting an appropriate face in a UE to
   retrieve a given content.  Based on the CCNx, an evaluation test-bed
   was deployed including an NDN UE (featuring an MA and a set of



Corujo, et al.           Expires April 24, 2014                [Page 10]

   network interfaces), a content server and a network node (featuring
   an ME).  These entities are interconnected by a set of NDN routers.
   The purpose of the evaluation scenario is to demonstrate feasibility
   for the protocol exchanges mentioned earlier.  Note that the code has
   been tested in a small-scale environment where the ME is topology-
   aware and keeps track of conditions of the access networks that are
   available to the UE.  Thus, the ME can provide the MA with management
   information reporting the appropriate face for content retrieval, or
   an alternative point of access that could be used to improve the
   performance.  The MA uses the management information to reconfigure
   the FIB (and possibly the network interfaces) in the UE, setting the
   appropriate face to forward subsequent Interests.

   For validation purposes, a local application was also implemented at
   the NDN UE that works similarly to a ping utility, generating
   periodic Interests that match a given prefix (served by the content
   server), and computing the Round Trip Time of each Interest/Data
   exchange.  The RTT values obtained by this application in [NDN-MGMT],
   indicate that the performance of the NDN management framework in the
   considered evaluation scenario is satisfactory, given the early stage
   of this work.  Further development and testing is ongoing.

2.2.  Video Adaptation

   This section investigates ICN management considerations for the
   delivery of video data, and especially the adaptive delivery of
   video.  From a content perspective, multimedia is omnipresent in the
   Internet, e.g., producing 62% of the total Internet traffic in North
   America's fixed access networks [GIPR2013].

   Video, and multimedia content in general, is has specific
   characteristics, which have to be considered and where network
   management consideration are necessary.  The consumption of
   multimedia content comes along with timing requirements for the
   delivery of the content, for both, live and on-demand consumption.
   Long startup delays, buffering periods or poor quality, etc. should
   be avoided to achieve a good Quality of Experience of the consumer of
   the content.  Of course, these requirements are heavily influenced by
   routing decision and caching, which are central parts of ICN, and
   which may be leveraged more efficiently by an intelligent network
   management.

2.2.1.  Adaptive Delivery of Multimedia Content in ICN

   Today's dominant streaming systems are based on the common approach
   of leveraging HTTP-based Internet infrastructures, which are
   consequently based on the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the
   Internet Protocol (IP).  Especially the adaptive multimedia streaming



Corujo, et al.           Expires April 24, 2014                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft        ICN Management Considerations         October 2013


   (AMS) via HTTP is gaining more and more momentum and resulted in the
   standardization of MPEG-DASH [MPEG-DASH], which stands for Dynamic
   Adaptive Streaming over HTTP.  The basic idea of AHS is to split up
   the media file into segments of equal length, which can be encoded at
   different resolutions, bitrates, etc.  The segments are stored on
   conventional HTTP Web server and can be accessed through HTTP GET
   requests from the client.  Due to this, the streaming system is pull
   based and the entire streaming logic is on the client side.  This
   means that the client fully controls the bitrate of the streaming
   media on a per-segment basis, which has several advantages, e.g., the
   client knows its bandwidth requirements and capabilities best.  As
   one can see, ICN and adaptive multimedia streaming have several
   elements in common, such as the client-initiated pull approach, the
   content being dealt with in pieces as well as the support of
   efficient replication and distribution of content pieces within the
   network.  As ICN is a promising candidate for the Future Internet
   (FI) architecture, it is useful to investigate its suitability in
   combination with AMS systems and standards like MPEG-DASH as shown in
   [AdaptCCN][InterAdaptCCN], as well as the possibilities and benefits
   of intelligent network management to improve the performance of AMS
   in ICN as well as the resulting QoE at the client.

   One of the most promising aspects in this context is the possibility
   of ICN to consume content from different origin nodes as well as over
   different network links in parallel, which can be seen as an
   intrinsic error resilience feature w.r.t. the network.  This is a
   useful feature of ICN for adaptive multimedia streaming within mobile
   environments since most mobile devices are equipped with multiple
   network links.  Here, a focus of ICN management could be in the load
   balancing of such traffic between the available links.  This would
   increase the effective media throughput of the multimedia content,
   however, it could potentially lead to high variations of the
   resulting bandwidth which is available to the client.  As DASH is
   designed for environments with dynamic bandwidth conditions, they can
   be compensated in general.  However, more conservative adaptation
   algorithms may prevent too frequent switching between the content's
   bitrate representations as well as compensate short-term bandwidth
   drops caused by network link switches more smoothly.

2.3.  Content Management

   An ICN network aims by definition to facilitate access to and
   delivery of information objects (content and services).  An ICN
   network can certainly do more, as it has been discussed in earlier
   sections.  However, as content (in particular, video) access and
   delivery seems to be the dominant use case in current host-based
   networks, ICN networking carries content delivery as a minimum
   requirement.  Indeed, virtually all ICN approaches so far include



Corujo, et al.           Expires April 24, 2014                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft        ICN Management Considerations         October 2013


   content delivery as a premise.  In that respect, from the perspective
   of a content owner or provider, an ICN network functions essentially
   as a content delivery network.  This creates a set of extra
   requirements for ICN.  Not surprisingly, content providers and end
   users alike should be able to Read (consume) a content object
   available on the ICN network.  But, in addition, a content provider
   needs the ability to Create (publish), Update, and Delete content.
   In this way, these three operations (Create, Update, and Delete)
   stand as the core aspects whose implications on ICN have to be
   considered.  For example, it's not obvious how content can be deleted
   from an ICN network that makes extensive use of in-network caching.
   In addition, Accounting, which is typical required by any service
   provider, also needs to be tackled.

2.4.  Network Policies

2.4.1.  NetInf Management Considerations

   Early-phase work in NetInf management [NetInfSelfX] discussed a two-
   fold problem.  The first question that arises is whether it is
   possible by adopting a new set of network primitives and in-network
   storage to usher a new type of network management.  In other words,
   can network management become information-centric while handling
   often host-centric data?  The second question is whether an
   information-centric network is more suitable for self-management
   mechanisms than IP-based networks are.  In particular with respect to
   the later, [NetInfSelfX] introduced some design considerations for
   adding self-management mechanisms in NetInf.

   Of interest from this early work are two examples where network
   management can play a new role.  First, network management can get
   involved in decisions about caching and (re)distribution of content,
   and not only whether an (inter)face is on or off, or what traffic
   limits should be enforced.  Moreover, network policies can be
   distributed securely in the same way as other content in the network,
   removing the need for centralized management, and enabling improved
   recovery procedures.  Second, network management can get involved in
   more intricate processes such as controlling multiaccess support,
   intermediating for content adaptation when deemed appropriate, and
   enabling richer tools for traffic engineering.
